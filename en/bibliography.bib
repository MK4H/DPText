  abstract        = {This paper presents an approach for parallel implementation of cross-correlation using the graphics processing unit (GPU). Cross-correlation is a central digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm with applications in many areas. In many cases in real time systems, a sequential implementation of the cross-correlation creates a performance bottleneck and prevents the systems from reaching the real time criterion. On the other hand, a GPU-based parallel implementation of the cross-correlation offers a solution to this problem. The proposed parallel implementation is integrated in an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. As a result, the OCT system is able to generate up to 40 en-face images from different depths from semitransparent objects in real time. This number of images provides the necessary information when OCT is used in areas such as ophthalmology, where detailed imagery of the retina, the optic nerve, and other parts of the eye is essential for accurate diagnosis.},

  abstract      = {We present a highly parallel implementation of the cross-correlation of time-series data using graphics processing units (GPUs), which is scalable to hundreds of independent inputs and suitable for the processing of signals from "Large-N" arrays of many radio antennas. The computational part of the algorithm, the X-engine, is implementated efficiently on Nvidia's Fermi architecture, sustaining up to 79% of the peak single precision floating-point throughput. We compare performance obtained for hardware- and software-managed caches, observing significantly better performance for the latter. The high performance reported involves use of a multi-level data tiling strategy in memory and use of a pipelined algorithm with simultaneous computation and transfer of data from host to device memory. The speed of code development, flexibility, and low cost of the GPU implementations compared to ASIC and FPGA implementations have the potential to greatly shorten the cycle of correlator development and deployment, for cases where some power consumption penalty can be tolerated.},

  abstract = {A sub-pixel digital image correlation (DIC) method with a path-independent displacement tracking strategy has been implemented on NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA) for graphics processing unit (GPU) devices. Powered by parallel computing technology, this parallel DIC (paDIC) method, combining an inverse compositional Gauss–Newton (IC-GN) algorithm for sub-pixel registration with a fast Fourier transform-based cross correlation (FFT-CC) algorithm for integer-pixel initial guess estimation, achieves a superior computation efficiency over the DIC method purely running on CPU. In the experiments using simulated and real speckle images, the paDIC reaches a computation speed of 1.66×105POI/s (points of interest per second) and 1.13×105POI/s respectively, 57–76 times faster than its sequential counterpart, without the sacrifice of accuracy and precision. To the best of our knowledge, it is the fastest computation speed of a sub-pixel DIC method reported heretofore.},
