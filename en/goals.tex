\section{Goals}

The goal of this thesis is to measure and quantify the effectiveness of optimizations for different cross-correlation usage patterns. The main objective is to compare the effectiveness of the implementation using Fast Fourier transform and the naive algorithm and measure the input size on which the effectiveness of FFT overtakes the the naive algorithm.

Secondary goal is to optimize the naive implementation from the thesis by \citep{misko}, describe any deficiencies in the original code and quantify the gains when these deficiencies are corrected.
